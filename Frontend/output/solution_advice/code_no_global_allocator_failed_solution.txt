Solution_1: [step1: Agent2: Introduce runtime assertions before dereferencing the pointer to ensure it's valid]
Solution_2: [step1: Agent1: Refactor the code to keep the pointer valid by moving `x` outside of the block, step2: Agent2: Add assertions to check if the pointer is still valid before dereferencing]
Solution_3: [step1: Agent3: Change structure by keeping `x` in a wider scope to ensure it is valid when accessed via `ptr`]
Solution_4: [step1: Agent1: Eliminate the use of raw pointer by using options or safe abstractions, step2: Agent2: Add logging to detect if a pointer becomes invalid]
Solution_5: [step1: Agent1: Replace the raw pointer dereferencing with a safe reference, step2: Agent3: Modify logic to use a scoped variable for `x` that lives long enough for `ptr` to be valid]
Solution_6: [step1: Agent3: Change the code structure to maintain the validity of memory allocations]
Solution_7: [step1: Agent2: Introduce runtime checks for pointer validity prior to dereferencing]
Solution_8: [step1: Agent1: Eliminate the use of raw pointers by directly using the Box value, step2: Agent2: Create assertions for pointer lifetimes]
Solution_9: [step1: Agent1: Refactor the unsafe pointer dereference by using a safe reference instead of a raw pointer, step2: Agent2: Add assertions to check if the pointer is valid before dereferencing]
Solution_10: [step1: Agent3: Refactor the logic to hold the Box variable in a suitable scope]
