Solution_1: [step1: Agent1: Utilize `Box::new` to allocate memory instead of directly invoking unsafe allocation, step2: Agent2: Include assertions to check that the Box was allocated successfully, step3: Agent5: Check knowledge base for alternative allocation strategies content]
Solution_2: [step1: Agent1: Refactor the usage of `handle_alloc_error` to check if the allocation would succeed before calling it, step2: Agent2: Add assertions to validate that the layout is not zero-sized before proceeding, step3: Agent5: Consult knowledge base to understand memory allocation strategies that prevent OOM errors]
Solution_3: [step1: Agent5: Research more about the specific allocation error in Rust, step2: Agent1: Refactor the code to use safe abstractions for allocation, step3: Agent2: Insert checks that log warnings before allocation attempts]
Solution_4: [step1: Agent1: Replace the call to `handle_alloc_error` with a safe Rust allocator method, step2: Agent5: Use the knowledge base to review best practices for error handling with Rust allocators]
Solution_5: [step1: Agent3: Modify the layout argument to ensure it points to a valid allocation size, step2: Agent4: Create a rollback procedure that undoes any partial changes made before the allocation failed, step3: Agent5: Leverage knowledge base to identify common pitfalls in memory allocation patterns]
Solution_6: [step1: Agent1: Refactor the code to use a `Vec<u8>` instead of manual allocation and deallocation, step2: Agent2: Add assertions to ensure that memory allocation succeeds before using the pointer, step3: Agent5: Consult knowledge base for best practices on using collections in Rust]
Solution_7: [step1: Agent3: Modify code structure to prevent immediate deallocation of `x` before it's used with `realloc`, step2: Agent2: Ensure that `realloc` is only called on valid pointers]
Solution_8: [step1: Agent1: Replace `alloc` and `dealloc` with `Box::new` to manage memory automatically]
Solution_9: [step1: Agent3: Change the logic to store the allocated memory in a temporary variable to ensure it exists while reallocating, step2: Agent2: Integrate runtime checks to prevent usage after deallocation, step3: Agent5: Look for common patterns in safe memory management]
Solution_10: [step1: Agent1: Refactor to avoid using unsafe directly by encapsulating in a safe abstraction layer, step2: Agent2: Insert assertions that check for dangling pointers before any operations, step3: Agent5: Gather examples of abstractions that manage allocation safely]
