Solution_1: [step1: Agent3: Redesign memory management by adopting ownership principles in Rust, step2: Agent1: Use safe allocation methods such as `Vec` instead of manually managing memory]
Solution_2: [step1: Agent3: Modify the code logic to avoid reallocating and ensuring pointers are not dangling]
Solution_3: [step1: Agent3: Restructure the code to avoid reallocations of raw pointers by using managed types, step2: Agent1: Use safe types such as `Rc` or `Arc` for shared ownership]
Solution_4: [step1: Agent1: Introduce safe abstractions by wrapping allocations and dealing with pointers via `Vec`, step2: Agent3: Evaluate and refactor logic to minimize pointer manipulations, step3: Agent5: Reference best practices on memory lifetime and ownership from the knowledge base]
Solution_5: [step1: Agent3: Modify code structure to prevent immediate deallocation of `x` before it's used with `realloc`, step2: Agent2: Ensure that `realloc` is only called on valid pointers]
Solution_6: [step1: Agent1: Refactor the code to use a `Vec<u8>` instead of manual allocation and deallocation, step2: Agent2: Add assertions to ensure that memory allocation succeeds before using the pointer, step3: Agent5: Consult knowledge base for best practices on using collections in Rust]
Solution_7: [step1: Agent1: Refactor to avoid using unsafe directly by encapsulating in a safe abstraction layer, step2: Agent2: Insert assertions that check for dangling pointers before any operations, step3: Agent5: Gather examples of abstractions that manage allocation safely]
Solution_8: [step1: Agent3: Change the logic to store the allocated memory in a temporary variable to ensure it exists while reallocating, step2: Agent2: Integrate runtime checks to prevent usage after deallocation, step3: Agent5: Look for common patterns in safe memory management]
Solution_9: [step1: Agent1: Replace `alloc` and `dealloc` with `Box::new` to manage memory automatically]
Solution_10: [step1: Agent1: Refactor the code to keep the pointer valid by moving `x` outside of the block, step2: Agent2: Add assertions to check if the pointer is still valid before dereferencing]
